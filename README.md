The user can type a new note with a name and title, then click a save icon in the top-right of the page to save the note and add it to the list of notes on the right. If the user clicks the write icon in the top-right of the page, it will clear the note fields to write a new note.

When the user clicks a note in the list, it should load that note's contents in the text boxes so the user can view the note's contents and edit if desired.
